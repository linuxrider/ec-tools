The differentiation and the integration are common mathematical operations.
The differentiation of an arbitrary function is often expressed by :math:`\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} f(x)`.
Interestingly, the integration can also be defined in a similar way:

.. math:: \frac{\mathrm{d}^{-1}}{\mathrm{d}x^{-1}} f(x)= \int_0^x f(\tau) \mathrm{d}\tau

Here it must be considered that a lower limit must be defined so that the integral is completely defined.
These operations can be then displayed in a more general way by:

.. math:: \frac{\mathrm{d}^{v}}{\mathrm{d}x^{v}} f(x) = \int_0^x f(\tau) \mathrm{d}\tau

With:

* :math:`v= 1`: Differentiation

* :math:`v=-1`: Integration

The so-called semi-operators are :math:`v=\frac{1}{2}` for semi differentiation and :math:`v=-\frac{1}{2}` for semi
integration. The following figure visualizes the idea of semi integration and semi differentiation.

  :alt: Image

A semi integration of a peak function (bottom left) results in a hybrid function (top) and
by applying another semi integration it is transformed into a wave-like function (bottom right), which is equal to
performing a regular integration of the peak function. The operations in opposite direction are analog,
except that semi differentiations and a regular differentiation are performed, respectively.

Semi Integration Methods
------------------------
Several methods exist for applying semi integration and semi differentiation, respectively.
These computations generally need discrete values, i.e. the function graph (see above) has to be seperated into
discrete finite values:

.. math:: f(0), f(\delta), ..., f((N-1)\delta), f(N\delta)

It is assumed that the step size :math:`\delta` is equidistant, meaning for a fixed set of x-Values N:

.. math:: \delta = \frac{x_N}{N}

The following algorithms (Gruenwald and Riemann & Liouville) are taken from Oldham in
:cite:p:`oldham_fractional_2006` and the fast Riemann from Pajkossy et. al. in :cite:p:`pajkossy_fast_1984_65`.


Gruenwald Algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
One method of semi integration was introduced by Gruenwald :cite:p:`grunwald_uber_1867_441` and
Oldham shows in his web ressource 1244 from :cite:p:`oldham_electrochemical_2013` how this type of semi integration
can be applied as an algorithm, called G1.

It can be generally expressed by the sum of the discrete function values multiplied with weights :math:`w_n`
divided by the stepsize:

.. math:: \frac{\mathrm{d}^{\pm 0.5}}{\mathrm{d}t^{\pm 0.5}} f(t) =\frac{1}{\delta^{\pm 0.5}} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} w_n
   f(n\delta)

The G1 algorithm is ideal for (cyclic) voltammograms, where the early signals are small.
**Note**, that these algorithms are less suitable for step and pulse techniques, in which the initial currents are
large :cite:p:`oldham_electrochemical_2013`.

The weights can be expressed in different ways. The single weights :math:`w_n` often depend on their predecessor
:math:`w_{n-1}`.
As the factorial expression could lead to an computive intensive overflow, this algorithm needs to be simplified.

The **Gruenwald G1 semi integration algorithm** is defined as follows:

.. math:: \frac{\mathrm{d}^{- 0.5}}{\mathrm{d}t^{- 0.5}} f(t) \approx \sqrt{\delta} \sum_{n=1}^{N} w_{N-n}
   f(n\delta)

Which can be also displayed in reverse summation to allow a more efficient
implementation:

.. math:: \frac{\mathrm{d}^{- 0.5}}{\mathrm{d}t^{- 0.5}} f(t) \approx \sqrt{\delta} \sum_{n=N}^{1} w_{N-n}
   f(n\delta)

With:

* :math:`w_0 = 1`

* :math:`w_n = \frac{(n-0.5)w_{n-1}}{n} = (1-\frac{0.5}{n})w_{n-1}`

The previous definition can also be applied as  **Gruenwald G1 semi differentiation algorithm** with some changes:

.. math:: \frac{\mathrm{d}^{0.5}}{\mathrm{d}t^{0.5}} f(t) \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{\delta}} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} w_{N-n}
   f(n\delta)

With:

* :math:`w_0 = 1`

* :math:`w_n = \frac{(n-1.5)w_{n-1}}{n}`


Riemann and Liouville Algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another method to determine the semi integral was introduced by Riemann and Liouville
:cite:p:`riemann_versuch_2013_331` and described by Oldham in :cite:p:`oldham_electrochemical_2013` as R1 algorithm
in his web ressource 1244. These sort of algorithms are mainly straightforward general-purpose algorithms.

The algorithm for the **R1 semi integration** is defined by:

.. math::

   \frac{\mathrm{d}^{-\frac{1}{2}}}{\mathrm{d}t^{-\frac{1}{2}}}f(t) = \frac{4}{3} \sqrt{\frac{\delta}{\pi}}
   \left[ f(N\delta) + \left\{ \frac{3}{2}\sqrt{N} - N^\frac{3}{2} + (N-1)^\frac{3}{2} \right\}f(0) \right.\\

   \left. + \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \left\{ (N-n+1)^\frac{3}{2} - 2 (N-n)^\frac{3}{2} + (N-n-1)^\frac{3}{2} \right\}
   f(n\delta) \right]

Similar to the G1 algorithm is the R1 for semi integration and semi differentiation. But it is not usable for
application to currents that arise from potential steps or leaps :cite:p:`oldham_electrochemical_2013`, as:

#. The large current at :math:`t=0`, immediately following the step is impossible to measure accurately and even if
   it would be possible, it is likely to be largely composed of a chemically uninteresting non-faradaic component.
   But the algorithm still requires a value of :math:`f(0)`.

#. The algorithm is based on the assumption that :math:`f(t)` can be treated as an assemblage of linear segments,
   whereas faradaic currents arising from a potential step and are non-linear with time.

The general definition for the **R1 semi differentiation** is:

.. math::

   \frac{\mathrm{d}^{\frac{1}{2}}}{\mathrm{d}t^{\frac{1}{2}}}f(t) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi\delta}} \left[ f(N\delta)
   + \left\{ \frac{1}{2\sqrt{N}} - \sqrt{N} + \sqrt{N-1}\right\}f(0) \right.\\

   \left. + \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \left\{ \sqrt{N-n+1} - 2 \sqrt{N-n} + \sqrt{N-n-1} \right\}f(n\delta) \right]


Fast Riemann
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following algorithm was introduced by Pajkossy et al. in 1984 :cite:p:`pajkossy_fast_1984_65` and is based on
the Riemann-Liouville transformation (RLT). Its big advantage is, that the computation time increases only linearly
with the number of points (:math:`N`). Here it is necessary to define some input variables (besides :math:`t` and
:math:`I(t)` data), where :math:`q` is equal to :math:`v`, describing a semi integration or semi differentiation.
:math:`\delta_t` defines the constant time intervall (i.e. :math:`t_2 - t_1`) and :math:`c_1, c_2` are constant
values, which is set to :math:`c_1=8, c_2=2` by default, as recommended by Pajkossy. With these variables, the
algorithm can be described as pseudo code:

.. image:: ../test/data/images/alg_fast_riemann.png
  :width: 500
  :alt: Image

Here, :math:`R` represents the calculated semi integral, i.e.
:math:`R \approx \frac{\mathrm{d}^{v}}{\mathrm{d}t^{v}} I(t)`.
